## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
Instagram: Liking posts, sharing posts, tagging accounts
Twitter: Bookmarking posts, Re-posting posts, Commenting on posts
TikTok: Stitching other videos to original posts, Commenting on posts, Sending posts to other accounts

This is completely off topic from the previous examples but an app idea I would love to create would help streamline attendance for teachers in the middle to highschool grade level.
Students would use thier phones to take a picture of the room number of the class room to be marked as present and then the app automatically puts the phone on airplane mode for the duration of the class.
Teacher will have the ability to mark students as tardy, absent, or even override them as present if they see fit.
Once the teacher marks the student as absent a custom text message is sent to the parents notifying them of the students absents from the class.
If there is a medical not involved after talking with the parents the teacher can mute the text from going out to the parents while still marking the student absent for said days.
## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
Navigating xCode for the first time and creating a GIF of the final product were the more challenging aspects of this pre-work
